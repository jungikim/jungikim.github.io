I am a senior research engineer at <a href="">SYSTRAN Software, Inc</a>.
I holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from <a href="">Pohang University of Science and Technology</a>.
I have possesses extensive experience with deep learning in the natural language processing and machine translation fields in both academia and industry.

**I am interested in all areas related to multilingual and Multimodal natural language analysis using machine learning with applications to natural language processing, information retrieval, and machine translation.**

At SYSTRAN, I have been working on applying deep learning technology in production systems for machine translation and natural language analysis.
Mostly recently, I have successfully completed a US (United States) government-funded R&D (Research & Development) project for developing a proof-of-concept American Sign Language-to-English
translation system leading a team of engineers, linguists, and data scientists.

Prior to joining SYSTRAN, I was a senior postdoctoral researcher at <a href="">UKP Lab</a> in the Department of Computer Science of the Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt, Germany, where I
conducted research on utilizing deep learning in multilingual semantic matching and multi-class classifications.
