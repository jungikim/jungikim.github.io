I am a senior research engineer at <a href="https://www.systransoft.com/">SYSTRAN Software, Inc</a>.
I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from <a href="https://www.postech.ac.kr/">Pohang University of Science and Technology</a>.
I have extensive knowledge and experience with deep learning in the natural language processing and machine translation fields in both academia and industry.

**I am interested in all areas related to multilingual and Multimodal natural language analysis using machine learning with applications to natural language processing, information retrieval, and machine translation.**

At SYSTRAN, I have been working on applying deep learning technology in production systems for machine translation and natural language analysis.
Mostly recently, I have successfully completed a government-funded Research & Development project for developing a proof-of-concept American Sign Language-to-English translation system leading a team of engineers, linguists, and data scientists.

Prior to joining SYSTRAN, I was a senior postdoctoral researcher at <a href="https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/">UKP Lab</a> in the Department of Computer Science of the Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt, Germany, where I conducted research on utilizing deep learning in multilingual semantic matching and multi-class classifications.
