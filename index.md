I am a <b>research and development engineer</b> with extensive knowledge and experience in the fields of natural language processing, machine translation, and information retrieval. I have a special interest in areas related to <b>multilingual and multimodal natural language processing</b>. I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from  <a href="https://www.postech.ac.kr/">Pohang University of Science and Technology</a>.

From 2014 to 2024, I served as a <b>senior research engineer</b> at <a href="https://www.systransoft.com/">SYSTRAN Software, Inc</a>.
At SYSTRAN, I focused on applying deep learning technology in production systems for machine translation and natural language analysis.
Mostly recently, I completed a government-funded Research & Development project, leading a team of engineers, linguists, and data scientists to develop a proof-of-concept <b>American Sign Language-to-English translation system</b>.

Before joining SYSTRAN, I worked as a <b>senior postdoctoral researcher</b> at <a href="https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/">UKP Lab</a> in the Department of Computer Science of the Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt, Germany. During my time there, I conducted research on utilizing deep learning in <b>multilingual semantic matching and multi-class classifications</b>.
